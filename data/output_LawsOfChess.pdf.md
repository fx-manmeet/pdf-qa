# Chessboard Initial Position

# Article 2: The initial position of the pieces on the chessboard

# 2.1 Chessboard Composition

The chessboard consists of an 8 x 8 grid of 64 equal squares alternately light (the 'white' squares) and dark (the 'black' squares). The near corner square to the right of the player is white.

# 2.2 Players' Pieces

At the start of the game, one player has 16 light-colored pieces (the 'white' pieces) and the other has 16 dark-colored pieces (the 'black' pieces).

- White pieces: King, Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, 2 Knights, 8 Pawns
- Black pieces: King, Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, 2 Knights, 8 Pawns

# 2.3 Initial Piece Positions

The initial position of the pieces on the chessboard is not specified in the provided text.

# 2.4 Chessboard Terminology

The vertical columns are called 'files', horizontal rows are 'ranks', and a line of squares of the same color from one edge to an adjacent edge is a 'diagonal'.
---
#

# Chess Piece Moves

# Article 3: The moves of the pieces

# 3.1 Piece Movement Rules

It is not permitted to move a piece to a square occupied by a piece of the same colour. If a piece moves to a square occupied by an opponent’s piece, the latter is captured and removed from the chessboard as part of the same move. A piece is said to attack an opponent’s piece if the piece could make a capture on that square according to the Articles 3.2 to 3.8. A piece is considered to attack a square, even if such a piece is constrained from moving to that square because it would then leave or place the king of its own colour under attack.

# 3.2 Bishop Movement

The bishop may move to any square along a diagonal on which it stands.

# 3.3 Rook Movement

The rook may move to any square along the file or the rank on which it stands.

# 3.4 Queen Movement

The queen may move to any square along the file, the rank, or a diagonal on which it stands.
---
#

# Chess Movement Rules

# Chess Movement Rules

When making moves in chess, different pieces have specific rules to follow:

1. Bishop, Rook, Queen: These pieces cannot move over any intervening pieces.
2. Knight: The knight moves to one of the nearest squares but not on the same rank, file, or diagonal.
3. Pawn:

The pawn can move forward to the unoccupied square in front of it on the same file.
4. On its first move, the pawn can advance two squares along the same file if both squares are unoccupied.
5. The pawn can move to a square occupied by an opponent's piece diagonally in front of it on an adjacent file to capture that piece.
6. A pawn can capture an opponent's pawn en passant if it has advanced two squares in one move from its original square. This capture is only legal on the next move.

# Competition Rules - Article 6: The Chess Clock

# Competition Rules - Article 6: The Chess Clock

6.1 'Chess clock' means a clock with two time displays, connected to each other in such a way that only one of them can run at one time.
'Clock' in the Laws of Chess, means one of the two time displays. Each time display has a 'flag'.
'Flag fall' means the expiration of the allotted time for a player.

6.2

a. When using a chess clock, each player must make a minimum number of moves or all moves in an allotted period of time and/or may be allocated an additional amount of time with each move. All these must be specified in advance.

b. The time saved by a player during one period is added to his time available for the next period, except in the 'time delay' mode. In the time delay mode both players receive an allotted 'main thinking time'. Each player also receives a 'fixed extra time' with every move. The countdown of the main time only commences after the fixed time has expired. Provided the player stops his clock before the expiration of the fixed time, the main thinking time does not change, irrespective of the proportion of the fixed time used.

6.3 Immediately after a flag falls, the requirements of article 6.2 a. must be checked.

6.4 Before the start of the game the arbiter decides where the chess clock is placed.

6.5 At the time determined for the start of the game the clock of the player who has the white pieces is started.

6.6

a. Any player who arrives at the chessboard after the start of the session shall lose the game. Thus the default time is 0 minutes. The rules of a competition may specify otherwise.

b. If the rules of a competition specify a different default time, the following shall apply. If neither player is present initially, the player who has the white pieces shall lose all the time that elapses until he arrives, unless the rules of the competition specify or the arbiter decides otherwise.

6.7

a. During the game each player, having made his move on the chessboard, shall stop his own clock and start his opponent’s clock. A player must always be allowed to stop his clock. His move is not considered to have been completed until he has done so, unless the move that was made ends the game. (See the Articles 5.1.a, 5.2.a, 5.2.b, 5.2.c and 9.6) The time between making the move on the chessboard and stopping his own clock and starting his opponent‘s clock is regarded as part of the time allotted to the player.

b. A player must stop his clock with the same hand as that with which he made his move. It is forbidden for a player to keep his finger on the button or to ‘hover’ over it.

# Article 7: Irregularities

7.1  a. If during a game it is found that the initial position of the pieces was incorrect, the game shall be cancelled and a new game played.

b. If during a game it is found that the chessboard has been placed contrary to Article 2.1, the game continues but the position reached must be transferred to a correctly placed chessboard.

7.2 If a game has begun with colors reversed then it shall continue, unless the arbiter rules otherwise.

7.3 If a player displaces one or more pieces, he shall re-establish the correct position on his own time. If necessary, either the player or his opponent shall stop the clocks and ask for the arbiter’s assistance. The arbiter may penalize the player who displaced the pieces.

7.4  a. If during a game it is found that an illegal move, including failing to meet the requirements of the promotion of a pawn or capturing the opponent’s king, has been completed, the position immediately before the irregularity shall be reinstated. If the position immediately before the irregularity cannot be determined the game shall continue from the last identifiable position prior to the irregularity. The clocks shall be adjusted according to Article 6.13. The Articles 4.3 and 4.6 apply to the move replacing the illegal move. The game shall then continue from this reinstated position.

b. After the action taken under Article 7.4.a, for the first two illegal moves by a player the arbiter shall give two minutes extra time to his opponent in each instance; for a third illegal move by the same player, the arbiter shall declare the game lost by this player. However, the game is drawn if the position is such that the opponent cannot checkmate the player’s king by any possible series of legal moves.

7.5 If during a game it is found that pieces have been displaced from their squares, the position before the irregularity shall be reinstated. If the position immediately before the irregularity cannot be determined, the game shall continue from the last identifiable position prior to the irregularity. The clocks shall be adjusted according to Article 6.13. The game shall then continue from this reinstated position.

# Article 8: The recording of the moves

8.1 In the course of play each player is required to record his own moves and those of his opponent in the correct manner, move after move, as clearly and legibly as possible, in the algebraic notation (See Appendix C), on the scoresheet prescribed for the competition. It is forbidden to write the moves in advance, unless the player is claiming a draw according to Article 9.2, or 9.3 or adjourning a game according to the Guidelines of Adjourned Games point 1.a. A player may reply to his opponent’s move before recording it, if he so wishes. He must record his previous move before making another. Both players must record the offer of a draw on the scoresheet. (See Appendix C.13)

# Chess Rules - Arbiter's Role

# Chess Rules - Arbiter's Role

Infraction of any part of Articles 12.1 to 12.6 shall lead to penalties in accordance with Article 13.4.

Persistent refusal by a player to comply with the Laws of Chess shall be penalised by loss of the game. The arbiter shall decide the score of the opponent.

If both players are found guilty according to Article 12.8, the game shall be declared lost by both players.

In the case of Article 10.2.d or Appendix D a player may not appeal against the decision of the arbiter. Otherwise a player may appeal against any decision of the arbiter, unless the rules of the competition specify otherwise.

# Article 13: The role of the Arbiter (See Preface)

The arbiter shall see that the Laws of Chess are strictly observed.

The arbiter shall act in the best interest of the competition. He should ensure that a good playing environment is maintained and that the players are not disturbed. He shall supervise the progress of the competition.

The arbiter shall observe the games, especially when the players are short of time, enforce decisions he has made and impose penalties on players where appropriate.

The arbiter can apply one or more of the following penalties:

- Warning
- Increasing the remaining time of the opponent
- Reducing the remaining time of the offending player
- Declaring the game to be lost
- Reducing the points scored in the game by the offending party
- Increasing the points scored in the game by the opponent to the maximum available for that game
- Expulsion from the event

The arbiter may award either or both players additional time in the event of external disturbance of the game.

The arbiter must not intervene in a game except in cases described by the Laws of Chess. He shall not indicate the number of moves made, except in applying Article 8.5, when at least one flag has fallen. The arbiter shall refrain from informing a player that his opponent has completed a move or that the player has not pressed his clock.

Spectators and players in other games are not to speak about or otherwise interfere in a game. If necessary, the arbiter may expel offenders from the playing venue. If someone observes an irregularity, he may inform only the arbiter.

# Cricket Event Classification Project Report

# Project Report: Cricket Event Classification

# Appendices

# A. Rapidplay

A ‘Rapidplay’ game is one where either all the moves must be made in a fixed time of at least 15 minutes but less
than 60 minutes for each player; or the time allotted + 60 times any increment is at least 15 minutes, but less
than 60 minutes for each player.

Players do not need to record the moves.

Where there is adequate supervision of play, (for example one arbiter for at most three games) the Competition
Rules shall apply.

Where supervision is inadequate the Competition Rules shall apply, except where they are overridden by the
following Laws of Rapidplay:

- Once each player has completed three moves, no claim can be made regarding incorrect piece placement,
orientation of the chessboard or clock setting. In case of reverse king and queen placement castling with
this king is not allowed.
- The arbiter shall make a ruling according to Article 4 (The act of moving the pieces), only if requested to
do so by one or both players.
- An illegal move is completed once the opponent's clock has been started. The opponent is then entitled to
claim that the player completed an illegal move before the claimant has made his move. Only after such a
claim, shall the arbiter make a ruling. However, if both Kings are in check or the promotion of a pawn is not
completed, the arbiter shall intervene, if possible.
- The flag is considered to have fallen when a player has made a valid claim to that effect. The arbiter shall
refrain from signalling a flag fall, but he may do so if both flags have fallen. To claim a win on time, the
claimant must stop both clocks and notify the arbiter. For the claim to be successful, the claimant’s flag
must remain up and his opponent’s flag down after the clocks have been stopped. If both flags have fallen as
described, the arbiter shall declare the game drawn.

# B. Blitz

A ‘blitz’ game’ is one where all the moves must be made in a fixed time of less than 15 minutes for each player;
or the allotted time + 60 times any increment is less than 15 minutes.

Where there is adequate supervision of play, (one arbiter for one game) the Competition Rules and Appendix A.2
shall apply.

Where supervision is inadequate the following shall apply:

- Play shall be governed by the Rapidplay Laws as in Appendix A except where they are overridden by the
following Laws of Blitz.
- Article 10.2 and Appendix A.4.c do not apply.
- An illegal move is completed once the opponent’s clock has been started. The opponent is entitled to claim a
win before he has made his own move. However, if the opponent's clock has been started. The opponent is
entitled to claim a win before he has made his own move.

# Guidelines for Adjournment of Chess Games

# Guidelines in case a game needs to be adjourned

# 1. Adjournment Procedure:

a. If a game is not finished at the end of the prescribed time, the player with the move must 'seal' their move in an envelope along with relevant information.

b. A player adjourning the game before the end of the session is considered to have sealed the move at the nominal session end time.

# 2. Information on the Envelope:

a. Names of players

b. Position before the sealed move

c. Time used by each player

d. Name of the player who sealed the move

e. Number of the sealed move

f. Offer of a draw (if applicable)

g. Date, time, and venue of resumption

# 3. Arbiter's Responsibility:

The arbiter verifies the information on the envelope and ensures its safe-keeping.

# 4. Draw Proposal:

If a draw is proposed after the opponent seals the move, it remains valid until accepted or rejected.

# 5. Resumption of the Game:

The position before the sealed move is set up on the board, and players' times are indicated on the clocks.

# 6. Conclusion of the Game:

If the game is agreed drawn or a player resigns before resumption, the game ends.

# 7. Opening the Envelope:

The envelope is opened only when the player who must reply to the sealed move is present.

# 8. Loss by Default:

A player loses if their sealed move is ambiguous, impossible to establish, or illegal.

# 9. Resumption Protocol:

If the player to reply is present at the resumption time, the envelope is opened, the move is made, and the clock started.
