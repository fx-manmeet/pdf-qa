# Event Classification in Cricket with AI

# CHAPTER 1: Introduction

# 1.1 Aim of the Project

Cricket streaming rights sky-rockets every new season, but still there is very limited innovation here. The task of classifying and generating highlights is currently done manually, but could be automated to some extent to make the process more dynamic. With this project we plan to build a Ball by Ball Event Classification and Highlights generation from a cricket match using deep learning approach.

# 1.2 Project Scope

Our website caters to a diverse audience of cricket enthusiasts, including casual viewers seeking updated information and personalized highlights, sport analysts and commentators seeking deeper insights for informed commentary, and media and content creators, including social media influencers and journalists, looking for engaging content and discussion points to share with their followers.

# 1.3 Project Objective

We aim to label each moment of the match, making it easy to display events and revisit them later if missed in real-time. Additionally, we plan to optimize the system architecture to provide low-latency event classification. The highlights will be dynamically generated based on the identified key events, with consideration of the user's preferences.

# 1.4 Project Modules

# 1.4.1. User registration and Authentication:

This module is the entry point to a customized experience on our platform. Users can register and set up their profiles, which guarantees a safe login process. This module not only secures user information but also facilitates a personalized experience by enabling users to specify their preferences and keep track of their activity.

# CHAPTER 2: Analysis, Design Methodology, and Implementation Strategy

# 2.1 Comparison of Existing Applications with Your Project

# 2.1.1 From Subjectivity to Precision:

Traditional manual methods rely on human interpretation, which can introduce variability in event classification. Our automated system, on the other hand, uses deep learning to ensure objective and consistent accuracy, thereby enhancing the quality of event recognition.

# 2.1.2 Speed of Delivery:

The manual creation of highlights is a slow and labor-intensive process. Conversely, our automated approach promises near-instant highlight generation, transforming hours of footage into captivating moments in real-time.

# 2.1.3 Scaling New Heights:

Manual processing struggles to keep pace with multiple simultaneous matches, as it is limited by human capacity. Our system breaks these boundaries, effortlessly scaling to accommodate numerous games.

# 2.1.4 Customized Viewing Experience:

Whereas manual methods offer a one-size-fits-all approach, our system stands out by personalizing content. It uses viewer preference data to tailor highlights to individual tastes, thereby deepening viewer engagement.

# Event Classification in Cricket with AI - Implementation and Testing

# CHAPTER 3: Implementation and Testing

# 3.1 Software and tools

# 3.1.1 Front-End Development

For the frontend development of the cricket event classification and highlights generation platform, React.js is utilized as the primary framework due to its component-based architecture and efficient rendering. Alongside React.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (ES6+) were employed for structuring web pages, styling the user interface, and adding interactivity. Additionally, Redux is used for state management, and Bootstrap streamlined development with pre-designed components and responsive layouts.

# 3.1.2 Back-End Development

Express.js served as the framework for building RESTful APIs and handling server-side logic, while MongoDB is used as the database management system for storing and retrieving data related to user profiles, match events, and preferences. Node.js provided the runtime environment for server-side JavaScript execution, and Git for version control. FFMpeg was employed for merging video files for highlights generation. For the requirement of continuously sending data to client from server for Server-Sent Events(SSE).

# Event Classification and Display

The "Matches" section serves as a hub for users to access ongoing matches, displaying a list of current matches available for viewing. Upon selection of a specific match, users are redirected to the live match page where event classification is predicted in real-time.

Alongside the match classification, a side box displays the Prediction Leaderboard, engaging users in interactive match predictions. This dynamic feature enriches the viewing experience by providing live match updates and fostering user participation through predictions, enhancing overall engagement with the platform.

# Classification Model

The classification model employed in the platform analyzes cricket videos, categorizing each ball delivery into four distinct classes: "No Run," "Boundary," "Wicket," and "Run." This model operates by leveraging deep learning algorithms to identify and classify the outcomes of each ball delivery in real-time. By accurately distinguishing between different event types, including.
